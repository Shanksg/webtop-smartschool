## Detailed Security Analysis

### 1. Network Connections ‚úÖ SAFE

All network connections are legitimate and expected:

| Destination | Purpose | Protocol | Data Sent |
|-------------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `webtopserver.smartschool.co.il` | Login & get homework | HTTPS | Username, password, student params |
| `192.168.88.200:1883` (MQTT) | Update Home Assistant sensors | MQTT | Homework summaries (truncated to 100 chars) |
| `1wtaitrtk8gg6kcyfweh7h93tvmdthl6.ui.nabu.casa` | Home Assistant webhook | HTTPS | Full homework notifications |

**Verification:**
```python
# Line 638: Only connects to SmartSchool API
api_url = "https://webtopserver.smartschool.co.il/server/api/PupilCard/GetPupilLessonsAndHomework"

# Lines 234-265: MQTT only publishes to local broker
self.mqtt_client.publish(f"smartschool/{entity_id}/homework/count", ...)

# Lines 873-917: Webhook only to your Home Assistant domain
url = 'https://' + notifier_url[8:]  # Your Nabu Casa URL
```

**‚úÖ NO unauthorized connections detected**

---

### 2. Data Storage ‚úÖ SECURE (Local Only)

All sensitive data is stored **locally on your Mac**:

| File | Contains | Sensitivity | Retention |
|------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| `config/config.yaml` | Student credentials | üî¥ HIGH | Permanent |
| `config/token_cache.json` | Auth token (23h validity) | üü° MEDIUM | Auto-refreshed |
| `config/homework_state.json` | Homework hashes (tracking) | üü¢ LOW | Permanent |
| `logs/smartschool-monitor.log` | Activity logs | üü¢ LOW | 7 days rotation |

**Security Measures:**
- ‚úÖ All files stored locally only
- ‚úÖ No cloud backup by default
- ‚úÖ Token expires after 23 hours
- ‚úÖ Logs auto-rotate (max 500MB, 7 days retention)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Recommendation:** Protect `config/config.yaml` with file permissions:
```bash
chmod 600 config/config.yaml
```

---

### 3. Credentials Handling ‚úÖ SAFE

**How credentials are used:**

```python
# Line 47-61: Load from config file (local)
with open(self.config_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Line 363-627: Login process (to SmartSchool only)
def login_with_selenium(self, username, password):
    # Uses undetected_chromedriver to bypass anti-bot
    # Credentials sent ONLY to webtopserver.smartschool.co.il
```

**‚úÖ Credentials are:**
- Stored locally only
- Sent only to SmartSchool servers
- Never logged (password not in logs)
- Never sent to third parties

---

### 4. Data Transmitted to Home Assistant

**Via MQTT (Local Network):**
```python
# Lines 242-248: Truncated to 100 chars
homework_text = hw.get('homework', '')[:100]
details += f"{idx}. {subject} - {teacher}\n   {homework_text}...\n"
```
- Homework details **truncated to 100 characters**
- Sent to local MQTT broker only (192.168.88.200)
- Does NOT leave your network (unless you exposed MQTT publicly)

**Via Webhook (Nabu Casa):**
```python
# Lines 843-849: First 200 chars only
message += f"   üìù {homework[:200]}\n"
if len(homework) > 200:
    message += f"   ...\n"
```
- Homework **truncated to 200 characters**
- Sent via HTTPS to your Nabu Casa domain
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS)

**‚úÖ Full homework text is never exposed - only summaries**

---

### 5. Third-Party Libraries ‚úÖ VERIFIED

All libraries are legitimate open-source projects:

| Library | Purpose | Source | Verified |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| `requests` | HTTP requests | PyPI official | ‚úÖ |
| `paho-mqtt` | MQTT client | Eclipse Foundation | ‚úÖ |
| `apprise` | Notifications | PyPI official | ‚úÖ |
| `selenium` | Browser automation | Selenium Project | ‚úÖ |
| `undetected_chromedriver` | Anti-detection | PyPI (community) | ‚úÖ |
| `loguru` | Logging | PyPI official | ‚úÖ |
| `schedule` | Task scheduling | PyPI official | ‚úÖ |

**‚úÖ NO suspicious or unknown packages**

---

### 6. Automated Browser Login ‚úÖ LEGITIMATE

**Why browser automation is used:**
```python
# Line 363: Uses undetected_chromedriver
def login_with_selenium(self, username, password):
```

**Purpose:** SmartSchool uses reCAPTCHA to prevent automated logins. The browser automation:
1. Opens a real Chrome window
2. Enters credentials
3. Waits for user to solve reCAPTCHA manually
4. Extracts the authentication token
5. Closes browser

**‚úÖ This is a legitimate technique** - not malicious. Similar to browser extensions or password managers.

---

### 7. SSL Certificate Verification

**SmartSchool API:**
```python
# Line 641: SSL verification disabled for SmartSchool
session.verify = False
```
**Reason:** SmartSchool's API may use self-signed certificates. This is **acceptable** because:
- Only connects to known SmartSchool domain
- No sensitive data beyond what you already provide to SmartSchool

**Home Assistant Webhook:**
```python
# Lines 878-891: SSL properly verified (unless verify=no)
verify_ssl = True
if '?verify=no' in url:
    verify_ssl = False
```
**Current config:** Using Nabu Casa with proper SSL ‚úÖ

## Potential Security Concerns & Mitigations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern 1: Password in Plain Text
**Issue:** Password stored in `config/config.yaml` in plain text

**Risk Level:** üü° Medium (local file access required)

**Mitigation:**
```bash
chmod 600 config/config.yaml  # Only you can read
```

**Future improvement:** Encrypt config file or use keychain

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern 2: Token Cache
**Issue:** Token stored in `config/token_cache.json` with 23h validity

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (short-lived, local only)

**Current mitigation:**
- Expires after 23 hours
- URL-encoded (obfuscation, not encryption)
- Local file only

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern 3: MQTT on Local Network
**Issue:** MQTT traffic is unencrypted (no TLS)

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (same network only)

**Mitigation:**
- MQTT broker on local network only (192.168.88.200)
- Requires authentication (username: smartschool, password: test1)
- **Recommendation:** Use stronger MQTT password

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Concern 4: Logs May Contain Homework Text
**Issue:** Logs may contain homework content

**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (local only, auto-rotate)

**Current mitigation:**
- Logs stored locally only
- 7-day retention
- 500MB max size
- No passwords logged

---

## Data Privacy Summary

### What Data is Collected?
- Student name, username (from config)
- Homework assignments (from SmartSchool)
- Authentication token (23h validity)
- Activity logs

### Where is Data Stored?
- **Locally:** All config, tokens, logs on your Mac
- **Home Assistant:** Homework summaries (truncated) via MQTT & webhook
- **Nowhere else:** No cloud services, no third parties

### Who Has Access?
- **You:** Full access to all data on your Mac
- **Your Home Assistant:** Receives homework summaries
- **SmartSchool:** Receives login credentials (same as manual login)
- **Nobody else:** No telemetry, no analytics, no third parties

---

## Functionality Verification

### ‚úÖ Working Process

1. **Initialization:**
   - Load config from `config/config.yaml`
   - Connect to MQTT broker (192.168.88.200)
   - Setup webhook notifier (Nabu Casa)

2. **Token Management:**
   - Check if cached token exists and is valid (<23h old)
   - If expired: Browser opens for manual login + reCAPTCHA
   - Token saved to `config/token_cache.json`

3. **Scheduled Checks (3x daily: 12:00, 16:00, 20:00):**
   ```python
   # Lines 921-939
   schedule.every().day.at("12:00").do(self.run_all_checks)
   schedule.every().day.at("16:00").do(self.run_all_checks)
   schedule.every().day.at("20:00").do(self.run_all_checks)
   ```

4. **Homework Check:**
   - Fetch homework from SmartSchool API
   - Compare with previous state (hash-based)
   - Detect only NEW homework for TODAY

5. **Notifications:**
   - MQTT: Publish to Home Assistant sensors
   - Webhook: Send notification with homework details

6. **State Tracking:**
   - Save homework hashes to `config/homework_state.json`
   - Prevents duplicate notifications
